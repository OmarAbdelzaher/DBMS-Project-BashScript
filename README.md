# Introduction
- This project is about implementing a DBMS (Database Management System) using `Bash Script` language

- It was a good practice to develop our skills in `Bash Script` and know more about its syntax, also know more about Linux commands

- To deal with tables structures we needed to use `AWK`, `sed`, and output redirection `>>`

- We presented some validation features like:

  1) Null Values

  2) If tables and databases exist

  3) Prevent creation of duplicate names for tables and databases

- Also the terminal shows friendly instructions to user to direct him to enter valid and proper inputs

- A Menu with flexible navigation forward and backward options is presented too
